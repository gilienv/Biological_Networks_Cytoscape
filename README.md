## COMPLEX NETWORK ANALYSIS FOR BIOLOGISTS
This is a one day training course on Network Creation, Visualisation and Partitioning, based on Cytoscape.

## Course Background
Complex natural systems permeate many aspects of everyday lifeâ€”including human intelligence, social media, biomedicine, agriculture, economics, even our personal and professional relationships. The past decade has seen intensification of research into structural and dynamical properties of complex networks. This course will introduce the basic principles of network theory, and hands-on DIY Network analysis using <a href=https://cytoscape.org> Cytoscape</a> one of the most widely used global platforms for construction and analysis of biomolecular networks such as gene regulatory interactions, protein complexes, hydrogen-bonding meshwork in active sites and neuronal networks. The aim is to conceptualize your own textual, tabular or genomic datasets as networks, and to understand how simple topological features can help to decipher complex properties of systems and processes.

## Course Content & Pre-Requisites
This is a one day long workshop with lectures, Hands-on modules and exercises for use of <a href=https://cytoscape.org> Cytoscape</a> in biological data analysis. The course is expected to be data intensive and participants are required to pre-install the software on their own devices as a pre-requisite.

## Intallation Instructions
Please go to https://cytoscape.org/download.html for downloading and installing the software. This is important to have on your devices before the training course.

If you have any problems with any of these requirements or are at all uncertain about your ability to complete the technical elements of the course, please contact our IT Manager, Paul Judge on pj237@cam.ac.uk. or contact Instructor G.Yadav on gy@nipgr.ac.in
